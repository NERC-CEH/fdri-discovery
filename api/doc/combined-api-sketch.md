# Combined API sketch

## Framing

After various investigations of API options we propose that FDRI adopt a dual approach to a combined API.

1. A simple REST API in the style of the existing metadata API and data APIs, with a unified set of query routes, and the ability to use metadata queries to define the data series to access.

2. A SensorThing API (STA) shim based on the STA [model mapping](../../ontology/doc/ogc-sensor-things.md) and [profiling](./api-profiling.md) already sketched.
