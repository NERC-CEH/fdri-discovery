CORRECTION_ID,CORRECTION_DESCRIPTION
LW_CORR,Correction for long wave radiation where calibration values are incorrect
SCALAR,Multiply the value by a scale factor. E.g. y=Cx where x is the data point and C is the scale factor.
ADD,"Sum the data point and correction value. E.g. y=x+ C, where x is the data point and C is the change factor."
POWER,"Raise the data point to a power. E.g. y=x^C, x is the data point and C is the change factor."
WD,Correction for wind direction orientation
PA_CORR,Correction for pressure where adjust has been calculated from mean sea level pressure
