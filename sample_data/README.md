# Fine-grained Metadata Store Samples

This directory contain sample schema and data files showing how resources might be represented in the fine-grained metadata store.

The Makefile contained in this directory can be used to build the schema files used to validate the sample data JSON files. The process uses a Docker image that runs some proprietary Epimorphics code, currently this Docker image is accessible only inside Epimorphics and cannot be run without the credentials to access the Epimorphics private Docker image repository. For this reason, we have also included the outputs generated by the Makefile in this repository so that they are visible to all users without requring access to Epimorphics' code-base.

The `schema` directory contains the schema definition for the Fine-grained Metadata Store. This definition reflects a subset of the full OWL ontology with a focus on ensuring that minimal metadata standards are adhered to and on minimizing the number of types of record that developers have to deal with.

The `id` directory is the root of the set of sample resources. Each sample record can be found in a separate JSON file. We have used JSON (actually JSON-LD) as a common format to bridge the gap from Linked Data to a more developer-friendly representation of the metadata.
